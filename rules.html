    <h2>Rules:</h2>
    <p>- Click ‘New Game’ to begin. </p>
    <p>- Player 1 goes first. You can roll the dice however many times you
        wish.</p>
    <p>- In the ‘Current’, it gives you the current score as you roll the
        dice. </p>
    <p>- When it hits a certain score, player 1 may want to ‘hold’ the
        score, which will then appear in the middle of player 1 as the total
        score so for, player 1 cannot roll anymore. Player 2 begins to roll. </p>
    <p>- If the player hits ‘1’ without holding any score, the current score
        will reset, and the next player begins to roll again.</p>
    <p>- Once one of the players hits 20 or more score, that player wins!</p>
